# Prospects

Prospects is an idea I implemented for a hackathon that was way too
short (total programming time was like 6 hours). I made a website that
lets the user repeatedly shows the user a deal, and two buttons next
to that deal: "I'll take it!", which lets them buy the deal, and "Hit
me!", which randomly displays some other deal. They may potentially
never see the current deal again.

It's chat roulette for deals.

There is also a Shopify app component that Shopify store owners can
install to expose their deals to Prospects.

The current code just samples deals uniformly at random (i.e. it's
just a mock-up), but one could also do things like user-modelling such
that Prospects functions as a targeted deals-recommendation engine.

I'd love to hear your comments about this idea.
